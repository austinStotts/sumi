## discord bot to make embeding links better.
sumi waitches for twitter.com and x.com links and sends a vxtwitter.com link  
allows for photo collections and videos to be seen without leaving discord  
  
also kinda works for tiktok...
  
## how to use
sumi wont do anything unless you tell her to  
you can toggle sumi on/off on a server wide or per user basis  
by default the server is set to on  
and each user is set to off  

use [sumi toggle] to turn links on/off for the whole server - ðŸ”’ must have managechannels permission
use [sumi toggleme] to turn links on/off per user
